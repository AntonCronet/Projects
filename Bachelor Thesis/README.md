#  Modelling the Swedish Krona Short Term Rate SWESTR: An ARIMA Approach
 
Abstract:
 This thesis investigates the feasibility of forecasting the SWESTR using an ARIMA
 model, in addition to evaluating the potential benefits of incorporating international
 interest rates as exogenous variables. More specifically the eSTR that represents the
 short-term rate in the eurozone, which the Swedish market is expected to follow due to
 macro-economic factors. Despite the inherent challenges in outperforming a random
 walk model, the results indicate that ARIMA models augmented with eSTR capture
 some variations in SWESTR, and manage to beat the random walk. This thesis applies
 known methods of forecasting interest rates by using ARIMA models on the SWESTR.
