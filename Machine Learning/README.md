# Bike Traffic Prediction using Weather Data

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning course.

* **Baseline model (Linear Regression):** implemented by a group member
* **Advanced ML models:** implemented by me (Tree models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network)

To go beyond the course requirements, we used **real-world data** and explored multiple models, hyperparameter tuning, and performance optimization. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was later applied, and all models were re-run to compare results.

---

## Objective

The goal is to predict **bike traffic** based on **weather data**, comparing different machine learning models by their error metrics and ensuring generalization without overfitting.

---

## Data Sources

* **Bike traffic data:** 5 counting stations in the Rhein-Neuss district, North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
* **Weather data:** Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) station in Düsseldorf (closest to the bike stations)
* Only dates where **all five stations reported traffic** were considered
* Data aggregated into a single "general traffic" measure

Data details:

* Most explanatory variables: **hourly**
* Some variables: **daily** (assumed constant throughout the day)
* Additional features: dummies for **Hour, Month, Weekday, National Holidays, and School Holidays**

Further information:

* Variable descriptions: `data/raw/VariableList.xlsx`
* Data sources: `data/raw/sources.ods`
* Scripts include **web scraping**, so data is refreshed when code is executed

## Methods

### Models Used

* Linear Regression (baseline)
* Tree Models
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Neural Network

### Evaluation

* Models trained with **cross-validation**
* Performance measured using:

  * **MSE** (training vs CV error, to check overfitting)
  * **MAE, RMSE, R²** (on 80/20 train-test split)

### Dimensionality Reduction

* **PCA applied**
* Models rerun to assess performance with reduced dimensionality

---

## Results

* All results summarized with **training, CV, and test error metrics**
* Goal: achieve close training and validation error (low overfitting risk)
* Comparison across models highlights trade-offs between interpretability and predictive accuracy

## Notes

* Large dataset allows robust training and testing
* Models optimized through hyperparameter tuning
* Results demonstrate how advanced ML methods can improve over linear regression in this real-world prediction task

Do you want me to also add a **short "How to Run" section** (with environment setup and commands), or just keep it descriptive?
